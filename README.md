### Hey there! I'm Eder 👋

I am an electrical engineer and a master’s degree holder in engineering with extensive training in humanistic, mathematical,
statistical, and scientific fields. I have experience in data science in three main areas: (1) processing and analyzing data using
classic Machine Learning algorithms for supervised and unsupervised learning tasks in Python, (2) building Deep Learning
models for Natural Language Processing (NPL), Image Processing, and Video Processing, and (3) implementing
Artificial Intelligence models in embedded systems. I have advanced mathematical skills that enable me to design all
these applications, which are supported by my ongoing postgraduate studies.
